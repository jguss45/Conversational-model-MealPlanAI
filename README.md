# Conversational-model-MealPlanAI
The goal of this prototype is to have a prototype for a chatbot that can potentially be used for MealPlanAI (https://github.com/jguss45/MealPlanAI), a web app I am working on for creating AI generated meal plans

This repository consists of a single jupyter notebook containing the MVP of a NLP model using the following technologies:
* Python
* Gradio
* Google Dialogflow API
* Google Translation API

This notebook demonstrates the integration of a Gradio frontend enabling user input, with the backend consisting of conversational model in Dialogflow and Google's translation API.
